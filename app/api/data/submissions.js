C knows the family very well, he calls all of the children his cousins, and the adults his aunties and uncles. It was noisy, it did upset him a couple of times. There was a lot of food, he did struggle to restrain himself and had to be monitored with his food and drink. But he had a good time, and said he loved having all the family around. He enjoyed sharing his toys, and even helped tidy and sort them after.",

B had an absolutely wonderful weekend – it was the carer’s grand daughter’s birthday party on Saturday – at jump trampolining, then a harry potter themed tea.  Then on Sunday, they went to Wxxxxx wonderland. B spent most of the weekend with the ‘little ones’ (ranging from 3-9?)  \r\nMY THOUGHTS:  B gets on so much better with younger children.  She told me she had made a new best friend in this 9 year old child.\r\n\r\nThe respite carer told me that they had a great weekend and that B had been perfect.  B was happy.  After a chat, B asked if she could see her boyfriend. She said that she would see him for 30 mins between 8 and 8.30, then unpack, shower, and be in bed for 10.  The boyfriend left about 10 mins late, (as always), and the shower ended up being a long bath. B was asked to get out of the bath 2-3 times.  \r\nI tried to talk to B about why she can’t do as I ask.  I said that next week, she needn’t bother to ask me if her boyfriend could come round on Sunday evening when she came home from respite as the answer would be no as she couldn’t/wouldn’t stick to her side of the bargain. B thought this was unfair and started arguing with me so I said good  night and left.\r\nHalf an hour later she was curled up in a ball on her bed. Light turned on.  I went in and asked if she was ok, and she said she was.\r\nMY THOUGHTS:  It feels such a shame that we’ve gone straight back in to negative mode.  Will discuss this with my SSW tomorrow.",

B had an absolutely wonderful weekend – it was the carer’s grand daughter’s birthday party on Saturday – at jump trampolining, then a harry potter themed tea.  Then on Sunday, they went to Wxxxxx wonderland. B spent most of the weekend with the ‘little ones’ (ranging from 3-9?)  \r\nMY THOUGHTS:  B gets on so much better with younger children.  She told me she had made a new best friend in this 9 year old child.\r\n\r\nThe respite carer told me that they had a great weekend and that B had been perfect.  B was happy.  After a chat, B asked if she could see her boyfriend. She said that she would see him for 30 mins between 8 and 8.30, then unpack, shower, and be in bed for 10.  The boyfriend left about 10 mins late, (as always), and the shower ended up being a long bath. B was asked to get out of the bath 2-3 times.  \r\nI tried to talk to B about why she can’t do as I ask.  I said that next week, she needn’t bother to ask me if her boyfriend could come round on Sunday evening when she came home from respite as the answer would be no as she couldn’t/wouldn’t stick to her side of the bargain. B thought this was unfair and started arguing with me so I said good  night and left.\r\nHalf an hour later she was curled up in a ball on her bed. Light turned on.
